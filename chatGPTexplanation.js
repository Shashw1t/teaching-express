// CHATGPT explanation for how express works and https requests are handled




// In a typical client-server architecture, such as with web applications, the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are sent by the client to the server. The server then processes these requests and sends back an appropriate response to the client.

// Client: The client is typically a web browser or another application that wants to interact with a server. When a user interacts with a web page, the client (browser) sends HTTP requests to the server to retrieve or manipulate data.

// Server: The server is a computer or system that hosts web applications or APIs. It listens for incoming HTTP requests from clients, processes these requests, and sends back appropriate HTTP responses.

// Express Application: In the context of an Express.js application, the server is implemented using Express.js. The Express application defines routes and handlers for various HTTP methods, allowing it to handle incoming requests.
// HTTP Methods: The client specifies the desired HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) when sending a request to the server. Each HTTP method has a specific purpose:

// GET: Retrieves data from the server. It is commonly used for fetching resources.
// POST: Submits data to the server to create a new resource or perform some action.
// PUT: Updates an existing resource on the server.
// DELETE: Deletes a resource from the server.
// PATCH: Applies partial modifications to a resource on the server.
// Request: When a client sends an HTTP request to the server, it includes the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) along with additional information such as the URL, request headers, and optionally a request body (for methods like POST and PUT).

// Express Routes: In an Express.js application, you define routes that match specific URLs and HTTP methods. Each route is associated with a handler function that gets executed when a matching request is received.

// Handler Functions: When an incoming request matches a defined route, Express calls the associated handler function. This function is responsible for processing the request, performing any necessary operations (e.g., retrieving data from a database, updating resources), and sending back an appropriate HTTP response to the client.

// Response: The server sends an HTTP response back to the client in response to the client's request. The response includes an HTTP status code indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found) and optionally a response body containing data or other information.
